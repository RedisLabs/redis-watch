# Redis Watch Edition #66

> January, 2017

## # include "i.h"

Recent weeks have plagued us with reports about databases being hijacked for ransom by attackers. While this isn't really news - this has been going on for years now - there is indeed a scaling trend in the number and severity of attacks. I compiled this little chart from **[Shodan @shodanhq](https://twitter.com/shodanhq)** data - can someone please explain how come there are so many 3.2+ instances?!?

### [The first release candidate of Redis 4.0 is out](http://antirez.com/news/110) (6:37.9 minutes to read)

We getting near the GA of the next major Redis version, and major it is indeed. ~~Ken the Warrior~~ **[Salvatore Sanfilippo @antirez](https://twitter.com/antirez)** highlights some of what's in scope: replication v2, LFU cache eviction policy, non blocking `DEL` and `FLUSHALL`/`FLUSHDB`, mixed AOF-RDB format, the new `MEMORY` command and... MODULES! MODULES! MODULES!

The current Redis version gets an update that every developer should get because it protects against a cross protocol vulnerability that can be used to attack your laptop from the browser - see [a proof of concept](http://bouk.co/blog/hacking-developers/) by **[Bouke vdBijl @BvdBijl](https://twitter.com/BvdBijl)** and [another one](http://whatsinmyredis.com/) by **[Mike Nolan @SxNolan](https://twitter.com/SxNolan)**.

### [The Results Are in – Redis Usage Survey 2016!](https://redislabs.com/blog/the-results-are-in-redis-usage-survey-2016) (2 minutes to read)

Have you ever wondered what other people are doing with Redis? Well, we have and our VP Product Marketing **[(((socialeena))) @leena_joshi2015](https://twitter.com/leena_joshi2015)** did a stupendous job in cajoling responses from the open source Redis community and Redis Labs' customers. 

### [An Overview of Redis Security](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sz60WMWtHQQ) (43:59 minutes to watch)

**[Salvatore Sanfilippo @antirez](https://twitter.com/antirez)** in a session about Redis' view of security ("not our problem"), insecure default security settings that "just work" and the complete recipe for unleashing a fecal tornado. Watch this if you want to understand the underlying reasoning and future direction of security and Redis.

Note: audio a bit wonky, but bearable.

### [Pull Request #3720: Active memory defragmentation](https://github.com/antirez/redis/pull/3720) (no reading needed)

Most Redis users never need to concern themselves with memory fragmentation, but there are cases where it becomes and ugly and expensive fact. While fragmentation isn't a Redis-specific issue per se, the only way to defragment an instance's memory is to reboot it (ouch). Or rather, that was the case until this pull request by Redis  Labs' Oran Agra was merged. Going forward, the built-in defragmentor (disabled by default) can remake a whole out of the Swiss-cheese that your server's memory had become.

### [Moving from Hazelcast to Redis](https://engineering.datorama.com/moving-from-hazelcast-to-redis-b90a0769d1cb#.3sr3aub33) (6 minutes to read)

**Udi Kidron** of **[@Datorama](https://twitter.com/Datorama)** tells about the migration of their centralized data store. The change, motivated by the desire to reduce operational overheads, was done gradually so the team was able to reduce risks and develop optimal solutions for each challenge they encountered. What I like best, however, is how the Redis community had helped, in this case the community being [Redisson](http://redisson.org)'s **[Nikita Koksharov](https://github.com/mrniko)** - well done :)

### [Moving persistent data out of Redis](http://githubengineering.com/moving-persistent-data-out-of-redis/) (6 minutes to read)

The story from **[GitHub Engineering @GitHunEng](https://twitter.com/GitHubEng)** by platform engineers **[Bryana Knight @bryanaknight](https://twitter.com/bryanaknight)** and **[Miguel Fernández @mikelodeon](https://twitter.com/mikelodeon)** is about moving in the opposite direction, in which data is taken out of Redis and into MySQL. Simplified operations are also quoted here as the motivating force in this case, but transition itself had been preceded by significant optimizations and infrastructural development.

The [comments at HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=13367077) are also interesting.

### [First-Ever Redis Modules Hackathon](https://redislabs.com/blog/first-ever-redis-modules-hackathon) (5 minutes to read)

Give a man a fish and you'll feed him for a day; give a developer the Redis modules API (and the promise for fame and fortune) and you've got yourself a hackathon! With five winners and over 15 finalists, it was definitely a great experience :)

### [Learn redis the hard way (in production)](http://tech.trivago.com/2017/01/25/learn-redis-the-hard-way-in-production/) (10 minutes to read) `#PHP`

There are only a handful of experiences that are more rewarding and educational than solving real production issues. That experience, however, often entails turning your hair prematurely gray and responsible adults have been known to be reduced to slobbering babies by it. To reduce your personal risk and save your mane's natural RGB value, you'd be wise to heed the lessons learned over the course of more than 6 Redis production years at **[trivago Engineering @trivago_tech](https://twitter.com/trivago_tech)** as told by **[Andy Grunwald @andygrunwald](https://twitter.com/andygrunwald)**.

The winning entry of the aforementioned hackathon is a Redis module that provides rate limiter based on the generic cell rate algorithm.

### [gryadka/GryadkaJS](https://github.com/gryadka/GryadkaJS) `#foss` `#JavaScript`

Gryadka is a minimalistic reliable master-master replicated consistent key/value layer on top of multiple instances of Redis. Using 2N+1 Redis instances Gryadka keeps working when up to N instances become unavailable.

Its core has less than 500 lines of code but provides full featured Paxos implementation supporting such advance features as cluster membership change (ability to add/remove nodes to a cluster) and distinguished proposer optimization (using one round trip to change a value instead of two).
