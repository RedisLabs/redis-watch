## `# include "i.h"`

Hello,

First and foremost I'd like to welcome our newest subscribers who have joined from Redis Weekly - if you do not wish to receive Redis Watch in the future, please unsubscribe using the link at the bottom. I also want to thank François-Guillaume Ribreau for his amazing years-long contributions to the community, and wish him only the best in all his future endeavors.

### OH [François-G. Ribreau @FGRibreau](https://twitter.com/FGRibreau/status/848932676572762112)

> After 4 years, 184 issues, thousands of subscribers, @RedisWeekly is merged into RedisWatch! [http://us7.campaign-archive1.com/?u=9d976d2d2f980dfd645881aea&id=cd6ad93f42](http://us7.campaign-archive1.com/?u=9d976d2d2f980dfd645881aea&id=cd6ad93f42)

Secondly, I've been working hard experimenting with [scaling (the ASCII logo of) Redis](https://gist.github.com/itamarhaber/7d40e0f29dba633b5a8a6183abc384c0) - lmk what you think.

And lastly, I always said that Redis is like a drug: easy to get hooked, makes the world a better place, but (RAM) can become expensive. Hence, the following is hardly surprising.

### [Redis on ARM](https://redis.io/topics/ARM) (3 minutes to read)

With Redis aligned to run on ARM devices, **[Salvatore Sanfilippo @antirez](https://twitter.com/antirez)** had added a new documentation page at [redis.io](https://redis.io) that includes relevant notes and some performance figures (hey, why no #PiZero?!?)

### [Stack Overflow Developer Survey 2017](http://stackoverflow.com/insights/survey/2017/#technology-most-loved-dreaded-and-wanted-databases) (54 minutes to read thoroughly)

### [Defining Moments in Database History](https://www.xaprb.com/blog/defining-moments-in-database-history/) (6 minutes to read)

A timeless piece from **[Baron Schwartz @xaprb](https://twitter.com/xaprb)**, who saw it all coming and continues prophesying.

### [Bash completion for redis server and cli](https://gist.github.com/dvirsky/99619d59ea836bb8ce6a4329e697094b) `#foss` `#bash` `#kewl`

Between this and that, señor **[Dvir Volk @dvirsky](https://twitter.com/dvirsky)** put together a thingamajig that adds command-line TAB-completion to `redis-server` and `redis-cli` in bash. To use, just save and `source` the gisted script from your `.profile` file.

### [A table of the shortest possible alphanumeric string that is mapped by redis' crc16 to any given cluster slot](https://gist.github.com/dvirsky/93f43277317f629bb06e858946416f7e) `#foss` `#C`

Another useful gist from **[Dvir Volk @dvirsky](https://twitter.com/dvirsky)** that should be come in handy for anyone who wants to develop her/his own code that shards into hash slots like Redis Cluster does. The author had used advanced techniques to generate this and promises the sequences are the shortest possible, making it ideal for embedding in with minimal stack overhead.

### [More fun than Clash of Clans - Redis on Android](https://twitter.com/itamarhaber/status/839201246288424962) `#foss` `#android` `#uberkewl`

If you're lucky enough to have an Android phone, **[David Martínez @vaites](https://twitter.com/vaites)** and **[Termux @termux](https://twitter.com/termux)** just made it possible to run Redis on it (although this does not leverage the new support for ARM). Is that a Redis in your pocket or are you just happy to see me?

1. Get [Termux](https://termux.com/) from [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.termux) or [F-Droid](https://f-droid.org/repository/browse/?fdid=com.termux), and launch it
2. Install Redis: `packages install redis`
3. Run the server: `redis-server`

A tale by **[Kurt Norwood @kortox](https://twitter.com/kortox)** of **[Amplitude @amplitudemobile](https://twitter.com/amplitudemobile)** that shows the power of server-side scripting with Lua, cutting latency and improving concurrency. The thing to remember is that even if your Redis topology is different than Kurt's, Lua is still the best way to go for composing commands and reducing the number of network round trips.

### [Redis NFL Leaderboard](http://dmitrypol.github.io/redis/2017/03/05/redis-leaderboard.html) `#howto` `#Ruby` `#Mongoid`

Don't let the title fool you. Yes, everybody probably knows that Redis' Sorted Sets are the natural choice for leaderboards, but in this article author **[dmitrypol @dmitrypol](https://twitter.com/dmitrypol)** includes an extra clever trick: using Mongoid for the mapping.

### OH [Kris Walker @kixxauth](https://twitter.com/kixxauth/status/838491680064094213)

### [Real-time Deduping At Scale](http://eng.tapjoy.com/blog-list/real-time-deduping-at-scale) (8 minutes to read)

Doing analytics on 2 million messages per minute is, to say the least, challenging. Once you choose at-least-once message delivery semantics, like the **[Tapjoy Engineering @TapjoyEng](https://twitter.com/TapjoyEng)** team have, detecting and discarding duplicate message can become a real pita of their Kafka-Spark-Postgres pipeline.

Enter Redis and **[ ♥ Aaron Pfeifer @obrie](https://twitter.com/obrie)**'s recounting of how it is used to dedupe transactions. To save on RAM overhead, Hashes are used as containers. To increase performance, Lua is employed to bring the CPU to the data. 

*Note: I'm somewhat ambivalent WRT the team's approach to scaling - application-side sharding is so 2013 ;) But then again, that really depends on your Redis deployment and Redis-as-a-Service provider ;)*

### [Want unlimited scale and performance? This is where to start](https://indexoutofrange.com/Want-unlimited-scale-and-performanceThis-is-where-to-start/) (5 minutes to read)

**[Szymon Warda @maklipsa](https://twitter.com/maklipsa)** reviews the foundations of key-value databases, and compares the prominent features between a few: Memcached, Riak and Redis.

### From SQL to Redis: [Chapter 1](https://medium.com/@stockholmux/from-sql-to-redis-chapter-1-145c82e4baa0), [Chapter 2](https://medium.com/@stockholmux/from-sql-to-redis-chapter-2-69663adb507b) (18 and 12 min read)

In a spinoff of his ATM 29-part "Node / Redis series", **[Kyle @stockholmux](https://twitter.com/stockholmux)** embarks on a journey after the mythical holy grail of NoSQL. His approach to data modeling is classic - table rows are represented as fields in Hashes, and indices are kept in auxiliary Set and Sorted Set structures. I like the emphasis on the importance of transactions and the use of `MULTI/EXEC` blocks!

The plot thickens as we move in to the land of `SORT` - Redis' most flexible command but also the most complex one: syntax-, time- and space-wise. Without going too much into the subject, if you're `SORT`ing you're probably holding it the wrong way ;)

Don't get me wrong, I admire Kyle's works and effort, but in my humble opinion this one's dangerously misleading. Even if it had come with a big **WARNING: THIS IS ONLY A THOUGHT EXPERIMENT! DO NOT USE FOR REAL!** sign, it would probably do as much good as the ones on cigarette packs. Some readers may take it too seriously and end up thinking that SQL can be mapped to Redis. While it may or may not be doable, trying to do so ignores the fundamental concepts on which Redis and other "NoSQL" databases rely upon. To use Redis effectively, you need to think different and model the data according to the queries.

**[Omer Levi Hevroni @omerlh](https://twitter.com/omerlh)** from **[Soluto Engineering @SolutoEng](https://twitter.com/SolutoEng)** is using Redis from my favorite Redis-as-a-Service provider for many purposes, but he has a feature request that we've yet to provide: emailing multiple recipients when a subscription's resources are about to be exhausted. I've already notified our PM team, but until we roll out this feature and for any other monitoring needs that you may have here or anywhere else have, Omri was kind enough (after gentle prodding ;)) to share his solution that uses [webdis](http://webd.is/) and a **[Nagios @nagiosinc](https://twitter.com/nagiosinc)**/**[Icinga @icinga](https://twitter.com/icinga)** plugin that [he wrote](https://github.com/Soluto/check-redis-plugin).

### [A Key Expired In Redis, You Won't Believe What Happened Next](http://engineering.grab.com/a-key-expired-in-redis-you-wont-believe-what-happened-next) (11 minutes to read)

**[Grab Engineering @grabengineering](https://twitter.com/grabengineering)** tell how they tracked down an unexpected behavior concerning cached unicorns, key expiration and the use of slaves... but as noted in the comments by the creator, this was first reported by YouPorn years ago (albeit minus the unicorns one should hope). That said, it is still an important lesson learn, so make sure you read it all the way through (including the footnotes, and especially the 1st one).
