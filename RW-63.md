**Happy 7th Birthday Redis!**

## `#include "i.h"`
_** NEWS FLASH:**_ A present from **antirez** for Redis' :birthday: - [100 more of those BITFIELDs](http://antirez.com/news/103).

Here's to another `u4(b0101)` magnificent years :)

Happy birthday,  
`BITAMAR`

**[Redis Trivia](https://github.com/RedisLabs/redis-watch/blob/master/trivia-archive.md):** `for each n in {3, 6} print(n^2-1)  # coincidence? I think not.`

### [Is Redlock safe?](http://antirez.com/news/101) (1 hour of undistributed reading +/-[clock skew])
This is **[Salvatore Sanfilippo @antirez](https://twitter.com/antirez)**'s rebuttal to **[Martin Kleppmann @martinkl](https://twitter.com/martinkl)**'s [_"How to do distributed locking"_](http://martin.kleppmann.com/2016/02/08/how-to-do-distributed-locking.html), which is, in turn, a critique of the former's distributed lock algorithm for Redis, a.k.a. [_Redlock_](http://redis.io/topics/distlock). Distributed systems shoptalk always generates a stir and Martin compiled a summary that at https://storify.com/martinkl/redlock-discussion, which includes this gem by **[Julia Evans @b0rk](https://twitter.com/b0rk)**'s [_"TIL: clock skew exists"_](http://jvns.ca/blog/2016/02/09/til-clock-skew-exists/).

### [The binary search of distributed programming](http://antirez.com/news/102) (10 minutes to read)
An offshoot of the item above in which **[Salvatore Sanfilippo @antirez](https://twitter.com/antirez)** is inspired to use Redis (or any other data store that satisfies two conditions), a majority and a variation on known algorithms for solving the problem of generating monotonically growing IDs.

### [New options for `GEORADIUS`: `STORE` and `STOREDIST`](https://github.com/antirez/redis/commit/bb75ecddfdcab4fb530bb9c78088e53b28687816) **`#GEOAPI`**
An important addition to the upcoming GEO API that enables pagination and set operations on the search's results.

### [RedisLabs/geo.lua](https://github.com/RedisLabs/geo.lua) **`#Lua`** **`#foss`**
I've put together a few GEO-related helper scripts to test some ideas. This is still **very much WIP** (the next version is almost a complete rewrite) so any suggestions/feature/etc is welcome :) BTW, Documentation Driven Development is awesome.

### [Saving memory in Redis with MessagePack and Lua scripts](http://blog.backslash.fr/optimizing-redis-memory-usage-with-messagepack-optimistic-locking-transaction-and-lua-script/) (worth every second)
**[Adrien Moreau/de Montgon @adrienmo](https://twitter.com/adrienmo)** did an outstanding job with this article because it explains how to elegantly solve a seemingly complex problem in a way that that's similar to how winning the jackpot should you feel: reduce the data's footprint, minimize network traffic and prevent race conditions. And use Lua :)

### [Redis, put your socks on!](http://mjelde.blogspot.com/2016/02/redis-put-your-socks-on.html) (<1 minute to read) **`#HOWTO`** **`#ProTip`**
If you're using Redis as a local cache - that is, on the same server as your application - you should really move to using UDS (Unix Domain Socket) instead of the network stack, as demonstrated by **[Olav A. Mjelde @olavamjelde](https://twitter.com/olavamjelde)**'s numbers.

#### **OH** **[Ben Nadel @BenNadel](https://twitter.com/BenNadel/status/702961662677143554)** > _Every time I interact with **#Redis**, it just makes me happy. Something about the simplicity of the API - it's joyous._

### [gamenet/redis-memory-analyzer](https://github.com/gamenet/redis-memory-analyzer) **`#Python`** **`#foss`**
RMA is a command line interface that examines your data in vitro and reports memory-related statistics. The idea is awesome, and **[Nikolay Bondarenko @misterionkell](https://twitter.com/misterionkell)** certainly knows his way around Redis' internals so the information reported is accurate as long as RMA updated with upcoming versions. I certainly feel there's a need for such tools, but since memory analysis is tightly coupled with Redis' implementation this functionality should make its way to the core... and it will :)

### [pampa/rutil](https://github.com/pampa/rutil) **`#Go`** **`#foss`**
Anonymous **[pampa](https://github.com/pampa)** (or maybe 9eb5?) wrote a small CLI "multitool" for dumping, loading and prettifying Redis data.

### [Redis Transactions](http://www.paluch.biz/blog/161-redis-transactions.html) (1.0 minute to read)
A trenchant review of Redis' transactions from **[Mark Paluch @mp911de](https://twitter.com/mp911de)**. 'Nuff said.

#### **OH** **[Mark Paluch @mp911de](https://twitter.com/mp911de/status/702607921952243713)** > _Created a text file containing string keys for all **#Redis** Cluster slots. Handy for testing. [https://gist.github.com/mp911de/5f9890496faca01b0ff9](https://gist.github.com/mp911de/5f9890496faca01b0ff9)_ <- handy indeed

### [Simple job queue in Bash using a FIFO](http://blog.garage-coding.com/2016/02/05/bash-fifo-jobqueue.html) (8 minutes to read)
A lineup of bash scripts that use named pipes for a producer-consumer pattern, and then some, from **[Stefan Petrea @wsdookadr](https://twitter.com/wsdookadr)**.

### [Buffering SQL Writes with Redis](http://blog.getsentry.com/2016/02/23/buffering-sql-writes-with-redis.html) (9 minutes to read)
**[Sentry
@getsentry](https://twitter.com/getsentry)**'s approach to data management is an example polyglot-ism: immutable BLOBs are stored in Riak whereas  variables are in Postgres. At scale, however, the data comes in at high rates and while an RDBMS is a marvelous tool for querying it, locking overheads quickly become staggering... which is just where Redis was put to use (4 years ago!) as a high speed data ingestion buffer as told by **[David Cramer](https://twitter.com/dcramer)**. FQ: _"Only time will tell how much longer until we face new constraints, but we're confident that choosing Redis early on was the right choice"_

### [Stack Overflow: The Architecture - 2016 Edition](http://nickcraver.com/blog/2016/02/17/stack-overflow-the-architecture-2016-edition/) (6 minutes to read) `#ScalePorn`
I love how open **[@StackOverflow](https://twitter.com/StackOverflow)** are with their operations and the semi-regular updates that the team gives are always a delight. The architecture/infrastructure that it takes for keeping it up is amazing consider its lean size (small is better) and the requests that it handles (big is better) - by **[Nick Craver @Nick_Craver](https://twitter.com/Nick_Craver)**.

### [Tutorial: Deploying a Replicated Redis Cluster on Kubernetes with Flocker](https://clusterhq.com/2016/02/11/kubernetes-redis-cluster/)  **`#Kubernetes`** **`#Docker`** **`#Flocker`** **`#AWS`** **`#HOWTO`**
A mouthful title with mouthwatering content from **[Ryan Wallner @RyanWallner](https://twitter.com/RyanWallner)** via **[@ClusterHQ](https://twitter.com/ClusterHQ)**, that is in fact an easy-to-follow (with pictures!) guide for building and operating a highly available master-slave Redis pair.

### [Redis Static Charge](https://medium.com/@stockholmux/redis-static-charge-7d047472ba34) (5 min read) **`#NodeJS`**
**[Kyle @stockholmux](https://twitter.com/@stockholmux)** tops the score (or more accurately, makes it a score) with a vigintennial post. This time, in the interest of science, Kyle refutes his own hypothesis that serving static content (i.e. files) from Redis using `GETRANGE`-based pseudo streaming would be faster than disk.

### [Building a Streaming Search Platform](http://insightdataengineering.com/blog/streaming-search/) (12 minutes to read)
Ryan Walker on how to build [Straw](https://github.com/rwalk333/straw) - a platform for near real-time search of a streaming text data. Besides code, the platform  consists of Apache Kafka, Apache Storm, Elasticsearch, Lucene's Luwak & Redis for the stream's processing.

### [jpadilla/redisapp](https://github.com/jpadilla/redisapp) **`#MacOS`** **`#foss`**
_"The easiest way to get started with Redis on the Mac - Just download, drag to the applications folder, and double-click"_... sounds easy enough. By **[Jos&eacute; Padilla @jpadilla_](https://twitter.com/jpadilla_)**.

### [Benchmarking Message Queue Latency](http://bravenewgeek.com/benchmarking-message-queue-latency/) (14 minutes to read)
**[Tyler Treat @tyler_treat](https://twitter.com/tyler_treat)** revisits his earlier benchmarking effort and polishes it using his lessons learned since. Besides asking "what about Disque?", this iterative process leads one to an obvious question: how do you benchmark a benchmark?

#### **OH** **[Javier Lozano @jglozano](https://twitter.com/jglozano/status/701829044157939712)** ><br /> _Step 1: Create table called "Redis"Step<br />2: Store "data" in "Redis"Step<br />3: Get immediate approval to use "Redis" in enterprise<br /><br />**#winning**_ <- Brilliant & you get to use [SEQUEL](http://www.almaden.ibm.com/cs/people/chamberlin/sequel-1974.pdf)!
