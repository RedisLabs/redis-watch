**OOH** **[Yuval Adam @yuvadm](https://twitter.com/yuvadm/status/689835539806187520)** > _@antirez i thought redis is already fast enough&trade; :)_

**OOH** **[inc=[src/\*\*/*.rs] @badboy_](https://twitter.com/badboy_/status/689856959290445825)** > _Threaded Redis ahead. What a time to be alive._

### [Dynomite with Redis on AWS - Benchmarks](http://techblog.netflix.com/2016/01/dynomite-with-redis-on-aws-benchmarks_14.html) (~20 minutes to appreciate fully, scales almost linearly with multiple readers)
Dynomite consistently delights me and that's a masterpiece benchmark from **[Christos Kalantzis @chriskalan](https://twitter.com/chriskalan)** et al at **[@Netflix](http://twitter.com/netflix)**.

### [Examples of using Walrus, a lightweight Redis Toolkit](http://charlesleifer.com/blog/examples-of-using-walrus-a-lightweight-redis-toolkit/) **`#Python`** **`#HOWTO`**
**[Charles Leifer @coleifer](https://twitter.com/coleifer)**  ain't just sitting on a cornflake, waiting for the users to come - he writes the howto and sees how they run, goo goo g' joob.

**OH** **[Rhian Lewis @rhian_is](https://twitter.com/rhian_is/status/687728162764095488)** > _So glad I made the effort to rewrite http://countmycrypto.com using **#redis** - much better performance and reliability!_

### [ZeroBrane Studio v1.3 is out](https://github.com/pkulchenko/ZeroBraneStudio/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md) **`#Lua`** **`#foss`**
The slickest IDE for [developing and debugging Redis Lua scripts](http://notebook.kulchenko.com/zerobrane/redis-lua-debugging-with-zerobrane-studio) and probably for any other engine as well just got a wonderful shiny update from **[Paul Kulchenko @zerobrane](https://twitter.com/zerobrane)** - a highly recommended upgrade.

### [Indexing Columns in Redis](http://www.codeproject.com/Articles/1072137/Indexing-Columns-in-Redis) **`#CSharp`** **`#UseTheSetLuke`**
Despite the title not making sense, this is an overview and code example of using Sets and Sorted Sets for indexing values by **[Najeeb Shaikh @najeebshaikh](https://twitter.com/najeebshaikh)** via **[@codeproject](https://twitter.com/codeproject)**. For more index-spiration make sure you familiarize yourself with the new-ish [Secondary indexing with Redis](http://redis.io/topics/indexes) doc page.

### [Embeddable data storage engines catalogue, tools and materials](http://engine.so/)
Cool to see two Redis-inspired engines on that list - by **[Dmitry Simonenko @pmwkaa](https://twitter.com/pmwkaa)**.

**OH** **[alexis richardson @monadic](https://twitter.com/monadic/status/690889597866393600)** _@antirez read that as Goedel. Without which redis is incomplete._

### [You should revise your Redis max connections setting](https://medium.com/appaloosa-store-engineering/you-should-revise-your-redis-max-connections-setting-8136f063c916) (4 minutes to read)
**[Benoit Tigeot @Benoit_Tgt](https://twitter.com/Benoit_Tgt)** provides a good drilldown into **`#Sidekiq`**'s client connections requirements in a post mortem on an **[appaloosa.io @AppaloosaStore](https://twitter.com/AppaloosaStore)** outage. Takeaways: 1) brilliant use of Slack's customizability for emojis, 2) connections are should be monitored like any other resource, 3) know the limits of your RaaS provider's plan and (I can't resist this last one) 4) switch to [Redis Cloud](https://redislabs.com/redis-cloud) - lower prices, more connections & alerting :P

### [twitter/rpc-perf](https://github.com/twitter/rpc-perf) **`#Rust`** **`#foss`**
A performance testing tool for Redis and Memcache (atm) from **[@Twitter](https://twitter.com/twitter)** with exciting existing/future ideas up its sleeve, including rate limiting, command playback & optional heatmapability.

### [How I built Sinklog.com](https://benwilber.github.io/nginx/syslog-ng/logs/stream/syslog/http/websocket/lua/2016/01/31/how-I-built-sinklog.com.html) (5 minutes to read)
Useful service for instantly creating a combined log stream and a pragmatic implementation by **[Ben Wilber @benwilber](https://twitter.com/benwilber)** that I find very appealing. Disappointing that the server itself isn't open source though.

### [Could CockroachDB Ever Replace Redis? A Free Fridays Experiment](http://www.cockroachlabs.com/blog/could-cockroachdb-ever-replace-redis-a-free-fridays-experiment/) (9 minutes to read)
Redis and **[@CockroachDB](https://twitter.com/CockroachDB)** are designed for different purposes, so my answer to the question in the title would be "no". However, the Redis API and the abstractions that it exposes can be adopted practically by any data management system, which is exactly what's awesome about **[Matt Jibson @mjibson](https://twitter.com/mjibson)**'s experiment.

**OH** **[Clayton A Davis #clayadavis](https://twitter.com/clayadavis/status/694968603720884224)** > _Stages of #redis acceptance:<br />0. Why would I want an in-memory database?<br />1. I see how it's useful in this case.<br/>2. This changes \*everything\*_
