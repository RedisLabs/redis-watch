# Redis Watch Edition #64
> April 1st, 2016

## # include "i.h"
Traditions, much like deadlines and rules, are made to be broken (btw, what do you call a tradition of breaking traditions and do you have break that one too?). It has been twice now that on April's fool, Redis' Lead Dev **[Salvatore Sanfilippo @antirez](https://twitter.com/antirez)** had announced [something](http://antirez.com/news/75) [awesome](https://groups.google.com/d/msg/redis-db/dO0bFyD_THQ/Uoo2GjIx6qgJ). Today, however, the announcement is that there is no announcement... or rather, that the announcement will be made within 1 month and 10 days at  [RedisConf 2016](http://redisconference.com/) (register for free with the `RLCONF16` promo code).

If you want a hint as to what that announcement is going to be, feel free to reach out but my lips are sealed.

Mmmmmm,  
Mmmmmm

### [Caching for a Global Netflix](http://techblog.netflix.com/2016/03/caching-for-global-netflix.html) (14 minutes to read) **`#CachesEverywhere`**
**[@Netflix](https://twitter.com/netflix)**'s _"EVCache is an extensively used data-caching service that provides the low-latency, high-reliability caching solution that the Netflix microservice architecture demands. It is a RAM store based on memcached, optimized for cloud use."_ It is designed for caching databases and memoization, but also offers strong global consistency (or eventual) and cross data center replication. The Replication message queue is handled with Apache Kafka with proxied relay clusters. By the EVCache's team: **[Shashi Madappa](https://www.linkedin.com/in/shashishekar)**, **[Vu Nguyen](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vu-nguyen-16b4303)**, **[Scott Mansfield @sgmansfield](https://twitter.com/sgmansfield)**, **[Sridhar Enugula](https://www.linkedin.com/in/sridhar-enugula-96ab953)**, Allan Pratt and **[Faisal Zakaria Siddiqi @faisalzs](https://twitter.com/faisalzs)**

### [RedisLabs/luascript](https://github.com/RedisLabs/luascript) **`#Java`** **`#foss`**
A much nicer way to run scripts from **`#Jedis`** - authored by **[Dvir Volk @dvirsky](https://twitter.com/dvirsky)** who'd love to get your feedbacks on it. Should be merged into Jedis if you ask for my opinion ;)

### [Luainsider - manage your Redis Lua scripts like a pro](https://gist.github.com/itamarhaber/e030fad40c5583b11e01) **`#howto`**
Apropos, here's a methodology, approach and apparatus for semi-persisting and aliasing Redis Lua scripts.

### [itamarhaber/file2resp.sh](https://gist.github.com/itamarhaber/c33ab7a067483050c47d) **`#Bash`** **`#foss`**
And not apropos, a couple of weeks ago, while working with GeoJSON, I was trying to load some bulky contents to Redis. I know of at least two  [Bash](https://github.com/caquino/redis-bash) [clients](http://redis.io/clients#bash), but both were too robust for my humble needs. Then came a [question](https://www.reddit.com/r/redis/comments/48wrqp/entering_large_string_1_mb_as_keyfor_a_key_gives/) from the community that had pushed me to share this.

### [How To Persist User Sessions Without Much Effort](https://www.compose.io/articles/how-to-persist-user-sessions-without-much-effort/) **`#NodeJS`** **`#howto`**
Sessionization is a favorite Redis use case - some of my best friends do that! - and this one here is a good intro to the subject. By **[Hays Hutton @haysh](https://twitter.com/haysh)** of **[Compose @composeio](https://twitter.com/composeio)**, an **[@IBM](https://twitter.com/IBM)** company.

### [coopengo/tryton-perf-analyzer](https://github.com/coopengo/tryton-perf-analyzer) **`#Python`** **`#foss`**
If you're using the [Tryton](http://www.tryton.org/) ERP project this could be useful. If not, just appreciate the ease of using Redis to monitor an application's performance including access to the primary database - by **[Ali Kefia @alikefia](https://twitter.com/alikefia)**.

### [Serializable cross shard client-side transactions](http://rystsov.info/2016/03/02/cross-shard-txs.html) (NaN minutes to read)
Seems simple enough... I wonder if it is applicable for uhm, lets say, Redis? by **[Rystsov Denis @rystsov](https://twitter.com/rystsov)** who keeps a very interesting blog.

### [Iterate over all keys in a Redis Cluster](http://www.paluch.biz/blog/162-iterate-over-all-keys-in-a-redis-cluster.html) (5 minutes to read)
Client authors: in case you were wondering how to abstract this, **[Mark Paluch @mp911de](https://twitter.com/mp911de)** did the thinking for you. BTW, Mark had [recently joined](http://www.paluch.biz/blog/160-hello-pivotal.html) **[@Pivotal](https://twitter.com/pivotal)**'s **[SpringCentral @springcentral](https://twitter.com/springcentral)** data team, so congrats are in order around the table.

### [a Scaleable A/B testing backend in ~100 lines of code (and for free*)](http://blog.gingerlime.com/2016/a-scaleable-ab-testing-backend-in-100-lines-of-code-and-for-free/) (5 minutes to read)

### [tidwall/tile38](https://github.com/tidwall/tile38) **`#Go`** **`#foss`**
_"...is a geolocation data store, spatial index, and realtime geofence. It supports a variety of object types including lat/lon points, bounding boxes, XYZ tiles, Geohashes, and GeoJSON._ Seems useful, definitely instructional and very reminiscent of something [extremely familiar](https://github.com/tidwall/resp) - from **[Josh Baker @tidwall](https://twitter.com/tidwall)**.

#### **OH** **[data['mafia'] = True @datamafia](https://twitter.com/datamafia/status/707805540030803968)** > _The sweet smell of #Redis. Best described as Twizzler and motor oil. #programming #LifeInTheQueue #queueLife_

### [Nmap Development: Ncrack postgres + redis modules](http://seclists.org/nmap-dev/2016/q1/284) **`#Security`** **`#Trivia`**
So that's actually cool in two ways, the first is obvious - I mean, who doesn't want to crack Redis, right? The second nice thing has to do with Redis and Nmap in general, so if you're idle scan through Nmap's docs to figure it out. Modules courtesy of **[Vaggoc Deirme @edeirme](https://twitter.com/edeirme)**.

### [Redis Login Utility](https://vulners.com/metasploit/MSF:AUXILIARY/SCANNER/REDIS/REDIS_LOGIN) **`#Security`** **`#metasploit`**
This one has no trivia, it is just a brute force attacker - protect yourself by following this quote from the default [redis.conf](http://download.redis.io/redis-stable/redis.conf) configuration file:

```
# Warning: since Redis is pretty fast an outside user can try up to
# 150k passwords per second against a good box. This means that you should
# use a very strong password otherwise it will be very easy to break.
#
requirepass foobared
```

#### **OH** **[Chris Black @ThatChrisBlack](https://twitter.com/ThatChrisBlack/status/708921505703272448)** > _I still can't get over how much faster Redis caching is compared to everything else I've tried._

### [Harnessing the Full power of Redis](http://danielmagliola.com/files/redis%20presentation.pdf) (PDF, 66 slides)
I had the pleasure of actually attending **[Daniel Magliola @dmagliola](https://twitter.com/dmagliola)**'s session at **[El Rug @lrug](https://twitter.com/lrug)** - if you already know your Redis, I recommend that you keep scrolling until the part about the phone rotator use case. Good stuff.

### [Unit testing Redis Lua scripts](http://blog.ulriksen.net/unit-testing-redis-lua-scripts/) **`#Lua`** **`#DotNET`** **`#howto`**
The one thing that always bugs me is unit testing Lua scripts - **[Harald S. Ulriksen @hsulriksen](https://twitter.com/hsulriksen)** shows how to pull that one easily off (although you still need a Redis server to run them).

#### **OH** **[Redsmin {Redis GUI} @redsmin](https://twitter.com/redsmin/status/711888989058441220/photo/1)** > _Yes! You can now track Redis #Cluster related metrics in Redsmin!_ <- Simply beautiful, kudos!
