# Redis Watch Edition #69

> May 4th, 2017

## `# include "i.h"`

Hello,

This edition begs to begin with a laudable numbers joke, but I'm refrained from doing that. Instead, let us note how May Fourth is just a play on June Third and snicker at this ripoff of what is truly a glorious day. Snicker snicker.

May the force be with you,  
Itamar

### [Redis 4.0 RC3 is out!](https://www.reddit.com/r/redis/comments/66vkli/redis_40_rc3_is_out/) (3.99998 minutes to read)

**[Salvatore Sanfilippo @antirez](https://twitter.com/antirez)** releases the third candidate (technically 4th?) for v4 is out with a boot-load of goodies ranging from features through fixes to improvements across the board. Barring stop-the-world issues and forces of nature, it looks a formal release isn't too far away. Two and a half notable observations about the RC's  impressive payload:

1. A substantial count of major changes
2. The <strike>force</strike> community is strong - happy May Fourth!
   1. More parties involved in fixing issues and contributing features
   2. Two of the biggest cloud providers' employees assist in squashing a family of OSS DB bugs (should that become a trend, **[Matt Asay @mjasay](https://twitter.com/mjasay)** will have to redo [Cloud convenience is killing the open source database](http://www.infoworld.com/article/3147864/cloud-computing/cloud-convenience-is-killing-the-open-source-database.html) via **[InfoWorld @infoworld](https://twitter.com/infoworld)**)

**[Santoro Simon](https://31337.it/about/)** had attended **[QCon @QCon](https://twitter.com/QCon)** London 2017 and took notes of what looks like an educational user story . Of particular (personal) interest was [this session](https://qconlondon.com/london-2017/london-2017/speakers/cem-staveley.html) from Cem Staveley, but both video and presenter are untraceable to this watcher's eye.

### [An Alternative Approach to Rate Limiting](https://medium.com/figma-design/an-alternative-approach-to-rate-limiting-f8a06cf7c94c) (9 min read) `#Patterns`

**[Nikrad Mahdi @nmahdi](https://twitter.com/nmahdi)** reviews the design of the homegrown rate limiting system that's employed by **[Figma @figmadesign](https://twitter.com/figmadesign)** to protect against spam attacks. He provides a wonderfully graphic explanation of three approaches - token bucket, fixed window counters and sliding window log - in native Redis terms.

### [Connect to Redis Elasticache through an EC2 SSH Tunnel](https://userify.com/blog/howto-connect-redis-ec2-ssh-tunnel-elasticache/) `#howto` `#jailbreak`

Due to security reasons, AWS' Redis-as-a-Service is not accessible to public interfaces. While this lockdown prevents some attacks, it also makes it impossible to just connect to from, lets say, your laptop. **[Jamieson Becker @JamiesonBecker](https://twitter.com/JamiesonBecker)** of **[Userify @userify](https://twitter.com/userify)** shows how to  set up a tunnel to quickly and effectively work around that issue.

### [Red hot Redis powers Netcore’s billion-plus connects for SMS campaigns](https://blog.netcore.in/redis-powers-netcores-billion-plus-connects-sms-campaigns/) (4 minutes to read)

**[Anil Shukla @shuklaanil](https://twitter.com/shuklaanil)** tells how **[Netcore Solutions @NetcoreSolution](https://twitter.com/NetcoreSolution)** had moved from a single Redis instance to a sharded topology. While a little skimpy on details regarding how sharding was actually done, this still makes a short nice read.

### OH [Joshua Cohen @heyjoshua](https://twitter.com/heyjoshua/status/855985862928150528)

### [Redis Pipeline Batching](http://taswar.zeytinsoft.com/redis-pipeline-batching/) `#howto` `#CSharp`

Three well-executed simple-n-clear diagrams by **[Taswar Bhatti @taswarbhatti](https://twitter.com/taswarbhatti)**, that make it hard to miss the points of using pipelining and batching (transactions). You can safely treat the code snippets as written in some pseudo language ;)

### [72squared/redpipe](https://github.com/72squared/redpipe) `#foss` `#Python`

My reaction to the project's promise - *"Making Redis pipelines easier to use in Python"* - was: pipelines work just fine, why change anything? But after reading [the (great!) docs](http://redpipe.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) about "a paradigm shift" to using "reusable blocks " and "duck-typing"... well, it makes perfect sense. Pythonistas should really check this one out.

*Bonus: both stand-alone and cluster modes are supported.*

### [gabfl/redis-expire-least-used](https://github.com/gabfl/redis-expire-least-used) `#foss` `#Lua`

A proof of concept by **[Gabriel Bordeaux @gabrielbordeaux](https://twitter.com/gabrielbordeaux)** that essentially adds usage-based expiry on top of Redis' TTL.

That's a very cool pattern that can be quite useful, as the graph "proves" - someone could develop a Module (s! Modules! Modules!) for that to take it to the next level...

**[Elena Kolevska @elena_kolevska](https://twitter.com/elena_kolevska)** gave a great talk on getting more out of Redis. **[Boyan Yordanov @specter_bg](https://twitter.com/specter_bg)** [summarizes](https://medium.com/@boyanyordanov/bulgaria-web-summit-2017-recap-edf5cda7bbb5):

> Then Elena Kolevska came on stage and showed us how you can improve the performance of Redis, just by reducing the number of requests, using pipelines or Lua scripts. And if you are a really hardcore developer you can go to “warp ten” by writing an extension in C. An Easter egg in her talk was that it was actually a continuation of a talk she gave last year at the Bulgaria PHP conference, which I also had the pleasure to see.

### [background_keys.c](https://gist.github.com/antirez/c07a6fdbd408f260aff14ab6d2ab5024) <- the day that Hell froze `#API`

On the quest of pushing the modules API further and farther, **[Salvatore Sanfilippo @antirez](https://twitter.com/antirez)** has made blocking commands even more powerful with a thread-safe context that allows interaction with the core. Put differently, this gist shows how to implement `KEYS` using a non-blocking, client-blocking module command.

The one-man-wonder **[Dvir Volk @dvirsky](https://twitter.com/dvirsky)**, with whom I proudly share a room and many opinions, keeps pouring absolute awesomeness into his uber-module. Here's a recap of what you've missed since last time:

* Queries turned to level 11:
  * Field modifiers for creating complex filtering on multiple fields
  * Allow selecting multiple fields
  * Optional terms and clauses
  * Match on prefix, (e.g. `Redis Watc*`)
  * Support for `NOT` queries
* Results are sortable by property
* Queries can have payloads (to be used by a custom scoring function)
* Support for dynamically loading extensions... let me repeat that: **Support for dynamically loading extensions!** Let that one sink in for a minute. Yes, that means the monster can haz its own modules.
