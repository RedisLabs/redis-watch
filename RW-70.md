# Redis Watch Edition #70

> June 8th, 2017

## `# include "i.h"`

Hello friends.

The past few weeks have been a roller coaster of frenzy activity, with RedisConf 2017 taking front stage at the May's end. Totally unrelated to that, I was interviewed by **[OpenChannel @OpenChannelTech](https://twitter.com/OpenChannelTech)**'s Michael Kovacs about [what I've learned being a part of the Redis community](https://devkit.io/blog/what-ive-learned-with-itamar-haber/) (note to self: do **not**  give phone interviews on weekend nights while nursing a single malt).

Before getting started, I want to direct your attention to a beautiful initiative from **[unixstickers @unixstickers](https://twitter.com/unixstickers)**. Quoting the post at [/r/redis](/r/redis):

> After months of intense work, we're proud to announce our new initiative to support FOSS with donations.
>
> We asked 5 FOSS idols to sign a handful of limited edition stickers, which are available until sold out. Each of the signers appointed a specific foundation or initiative that will benefit from the proceeds raised through the initiative.
>
> Here are the 5 FOSS idols, who we couldn't be more thankful with:
>
> - Dave Gandy, founder of Font Awesome (all donations go to New Story Charity [newstorycharity.org](http://newstorycharity.org))

### [Redis 3.2.9 is out](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/antirez/redis/3.2/00-RELEASENOTES) `#v4IsComing`

A minor release with a few bug fixes and a **low** update urgency. Expect a lot more from **[Salvatore Sanfilippo @antirez](https://twitter.com/antirez)** in the near future...

### [RedisLabs/triemap](https://github.com/RedisLabs/triemap) `#foss` `#BSD2Clause` `#C`

Is a C implementation of a compressed [trie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trie) lookup map. **[Dvir Volk @dvirsky](https://twitter.com/dvirsky)** made it to power some of the awesomeness (e.g. auto-complete) in [RediSearch](http://redisearch.io/).

### [antirez/rax](https://github.com/antirez/rax) `#foss` `#BSD2Clause` `#c`

Is a [radix tree](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radix_tree) implementation in ANSI C by **[Salvatore Sanfilippo @antirez](https://twitter.com/antirez)**. This cool data structure was suggested as a fix to a regression in the cluster's performance and will be used for that in v4. However, it will be put to more extensive use in future versions of Redis, improving performance and reducing the overheads and complexity of internal data structures such as the hash dictionary (bonus: looks like we're gonna get efficient prefix searches on key names :)).

**[Krishnan Chandra](https://www.reddit.com/user/shrink_and_an_arch)**, a senior software engineer at **[Reddit @reddit](https://twitter.com/reddit)**, tells how Redis' HyperLogLog is used alongside Cassandra in a Kafka-esque pipeline to count views at (Reddit's) scale.

### [Efficient analytics with Redis Bitmaps](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a-BtWlU55kk) (3:19 minutes to watch)

Bitmaps are well-explored territory, but this video manages to get across the main points and build just enough interest to encourage you to go on an auto-didactic journey - from **[Ivan Zarea @ivanzarea](https://twitter.com/ivanzarea)**.

### [activityclub/pointspaced](https://github.com/activityclub/pointspaced) `#foss` `#MIT` `#golang` `#Lua`

Is a server that collects and aggregates data into a very neat data structure made up of collections of (Redis) hashes. Despite being written in Go, the heavy lifting of doing the writes is contained in a Lua script that can be easily called from any language (caution: see [issue #1](https://github.com/activityclub/pointspaced/issues/1)).

> Thinking about real-time... For Pub/Sub, we chose Redis — an open source (BSD licensed), in-memory data structure store, used as a database, cache and message broker — as our team was very familiar with it. This tool has an utmost importance for the operation of our new architecture, allowing messages to the almost instantaneously published without harming our web service performance.

### [How to Use Elasticsearch, Logstash, and Kibana to Manage Redis Logs](https://qbox.io/blog/redis-logs-elasticsearch-logstash-kibana) `#howto` `#devops`

The title sums it up nicely, and the article appears to have all the required details to get you from 0 to 11. By **[Adam Vanderbush @CommandrAvander](https://twitter.com/CommandrAvander)** of **[Qbox.io @qboxio](https://twitter.com/qboxio)**.

*Note: I wonder if Elasticsearch could be replaced by, lets say, RediSearch?*

### [Remote Redis: Spiped vs Stunnel](https://itschr.is/remote-redis-spiped-vs-stunnel/) (4 minutes to read)

**[Chris Tanner](https://www.instagram.com/itschr.is/)** takes lovely photos, but in between he also tested the performance of the two approaches for securing the communication to a remote Redis server. Looks like we have a winner (spoiler: stunnel).

*Note: if anyone knows Chris' Twitter handle so he can be credited please lmk (I don't have an Instagram account)*

### [RedisLabs/sentinel_tunnel](https://github.com/RedisLabs/sentinel_tunnel) `#foss` `#BSD2Clause` `#golang`

Is a local proxy server for discovering and connecting to Redis via Sentinel. The idea is simple but extremely effective - the proxy does all the heavy lifting of connecting to the current Redis master by chatting with the configured Sentinel deployment, and provides a local port to which a client can connect. The client doesn't know anything about the underlaying complexities and is oblivious to failures without requiring any special configuration or code changes.

**[Bob Cao @bobintornado](https://twitter.com/bobintornado)** scratches my itch for rate limiters and makes an opening that I find irresistible to not quoting:

> Redis is an awesome piece of software, and I am hugely biased towards it. It’s very versatile and powerful, could fulfill a wide range of use cases, such as implementing a rate limiter.

### [A Redis 4 Docker Image Proposal](https://medium.com/@andrenit/a-redis-4-docker-image-proposal-4112990eb5d2) `#howto` `#Docker`

**[André Fernandes @andrenit](https://twitter.com/andrenit)** presents his proposal for a v4 image, leveraging Docker 17.05's multi-stage builds to slap a server+module image together.  If anyone reading this is a Docker guru it would be good to get more feedback on that. Personally, he got me at ReJSON ;)

### [Redis Performance Triage Handook](https://aadrake.com/posts/2017-05-15-redis-performance-triage-handbook.html) `#protip`

3. Pipeline your commands

... and 7 more.

### [zdharma/zredis](https://github.com/zdharma/zredis) `#foss` `#GPL3` `#Zsh`

Is a Redis database mapping for Zsh by the **[Zdharma Initiative @ZdharmaI](https://twitter.com/ZdharmaI)**, for example:

> ... Armed with this knowledge, we introduced a Redis cache for our Mongo database, a huge performance and availability win ... We quickly saw a massive decrease in the load on the Mongo database. In the left of the below graph, you’ll see the amount of queries before adding the Redis cache. The right hand side shows after adding the Redis cache, decreasing the load to almost nothing.
