## Virtual Moka Pot
Since time immemorial within the Redis community, a [Moka Pot](http://oldblog.antirez.com/post/redis-moka-awards-2011.html) is considered a token of appreciation to a member for her/his contributions. Iâ€™d like to present this one to [RB_GC_GUARD(v) "Jan-Erik Rediger" @badboy_](https://twitter.com/badboy_) for his years-long activity and countless contributions to the Redis community. Just to give a taste, here are a few recent ones:

*  **OH** [Runtime.dynCall($0) @badboy_](https://twitter.com/badboy_/status/677815982656782336) > 
_Turns out I'm now the co-maintainer of r2d2-redis: https://crates.io/crates/r2d2_redis/ _
_If you need a connection pool for Redis, use it._ <- `#Rust`
* [hiredis-rb v0.6.1](https://github.com/redis/hiredis-rb/releases/tag/v0.6.1) - and just in time for `#Rails5`
* [The last merge of the year](https://github.com/antirez/redis-doc/pull/650) `#SFW`

Jan-Erik - for being the total opposite of your handle, may your coffee always taste as good as a cup of Italian Moka, danke und ein gl&uuml;ckliches neues Jahr.

### [Redis 3.2 Release Candidate 1 is out!](https://www.reddit.com/r/redis/comments/3xyhyn/redis_32_release_candidate_1_is_out/) (4 minutes to read)
It could be because Redis' development is moving towards a time-driven release cycle, but the latest release from [Salvatore Sanfilippo @antirez](https://twitter.com/antirez) feels like an Xmas gift to me - it is filled to the brim with goodness that we've been waiting for forever. The new functionality includes geospatial indexes, cluster rebalancing, Lua effects replication, an embedded Lua debugger and variadic `SPOP` (!!!). And while all this will certainly delight developer personas, the new version has more than enough for the operations-minded folks as well as it brings **drastic improvements** in performance and memory overheads of many use cases. 

Because most changes have been thoroughly tested prior to the release candidate's release, v3.2RC1 is likely to be around only for a short while. Another release candidate for the cluster's integration with Docker and security improvements will replace it, so in all likelihood v3.2 will be production-ready early next year.

### [Redis 3.0.6 and 2.8.24 are out](https://www.reddit.com/r/redis/comments/3xcw1g/redis_306_and_2824_are_out/) (2 minutes to read)
A minor release that includes a few fixes and backports from v3.2. Most notably, a rare crash was addressed and an integer overflow security vulnerability in Lua was fixed. The recommended upgrade urgency is _MODERATE_.

### [3 Critical Points about Security](https://redislabs.com/blog/3-critical-points-about-security) (3.14 minutes to read, an eternity in hell if you don't) `#PSA`
1. Never leave an unprotected server open to the outside world
2. If your server has been compromised - burn it
3. Always read the documentation

### [Memory As A Service](https://blog.shodan.io/memory-as-a-service/) (2 minutes to read) `#MaaS`
I admire the work that [John Matherly @achillean](https://twitter.com/achillean) is doing to raise public awareness to security issues, and at least some of the recent NoSQL-security-related public debates can be attributed directly to him and the [Shodan @shodanhq](https://twitter.com/shodanhq) project. When you think about it, the only way to address security vulnerabilities is to publicly expose them since otherwise they remain exposed to potential wrongdoers. While this post is about `#Memcached`, the lessons apply to most databases that are publicly exposed, Redis included. This post also deserves a <3 for the creative term-coining in title.

### [swizzlr/swift-redis](https://github.com/swizzlr/swift-redis) `#Swift` `#foss`
Apparently, Apple's Swift has just become a serious server-side language :) by [Swizzmas @swizzlr](https://twitter.com/swizzlr).

### **OH** [Sam Saffron @samsaffron](https://twitter.com/samsaffron/status/678701348297158657) > _@dhh this is just a bit too much [https://github.com/rails...#L28](https://github.com/rails/rails/blob/master/rails.gemspec#L28) now every Rails install requires redis, eventmacine, celluloid and faye_ <- Do Action Cable's dependencies derail #Rails5?

### [Redis For Everything](http://youtu.be/SIUOCKviitw) (25:59 minutes to watch)
[Yaron Wittenstein @RealWittenstein](https://twitter.com/RealWittenstein) from [Spot.IM @spot_im](https://twitter.com/spot_im) gave this delightful talk at the recent [R@RailsIsrael](https://twitter.com/RailsIsrael) ([the view from a front-row seat](https://twitter.com/itamarhaber/status/669120394633326593)) - via [@Code4WD](https://twitter.com/Code4WD)/[Raphael Fogel @fogelmania](https://twitter.com/fogelmania).

### [Intro to Redis part 1](http://zackurben.com/blog/intro-to-redis-part-1/) (5 minutes to read)
Even if only for its opening: _"I've recently rekindled my love for Redis...its elegance lures me for every project." - by _"code warrior"_ [Zack Urben @zackurben](https://twitter.com/zackurben) from [Form.io @form_io](https://twitter.com/form_io). I hate `#cliffhangers`.

### [Under the Hood of Redis: Strings](http://redisplanet.com/redis/under-the-hood-of-redis-strings/) (Reading time ~11 minutes ) `#InfernalInternals`
For those of us who don't read [Russian](http://habrahabr.ru/post/271487/), [Nikolay Bondarenko @misterionkell](https://twitter.com/misterionkell) put up a new promising blog and the first post is a great hard core `#codeporn` (albeit slightly outdated ;)) dive into Redis' internals and the magical number 56.
