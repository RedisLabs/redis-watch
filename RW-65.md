## Redis Modules

During the last months Redis has been getting a very special treatment that will change the way it is used for ever. I'm referring, of course, to the new Redis Modules API that was unveiled last month by **[Salvatore Sanfilippo @antirez](https://twitter.com/antirez)** at [RedisConf](http://redisconference.com) (sorry for the secrecy, but everything's worth trying at least once, right?)

TL;DR Redis Modules are dynamic libraries written in C (but in theory in any language with C bindings will do). They are binary-compatible with future Redis versions and allow anyone to add her/his own commands and data structures. Modules access data in Redis either via a high-level interface that's not unlike the `redis.call` function in Redis' Lua scripts, or via a low-level API that performs nearly as fast as native Redis commands. The API also provides support for things like memory management, arguments, replies and responses.

If you're interested in more details, here's where you need to go:

1. [Redis Loadable Modules System](http://antirez.com/news/106) (12 minutes to read) - **[Salvatore Sanfilippo @antirez](https://twitter.com/antirez)** inaugural post about Redis Modules covers everything from the beginning of time (i.e. v1.0) to the present day.  [/r/redis](https://www.reddit.com/r/redis/comments/4irk2c/redis_modules/) [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11670162)
2. The `unstable` branch of Redis' repository has everything you need to develop a module under the `src/modules` directory. Specifically:
 1. [INTRO.md](https://github.com/antirez/redis/blob/unstable/src/modules/INTRO.md) is an introduction to the Redis Modules API - start here to get a feel for it.
 2. Follow the examples in [helloworld.c](https://github.com/antirez/redis/blob/unstable/src/modules/helloworld.c) to see how the different API calls are used in a module.
 3. The [TYPES.md](https://github.com/antirez/redis/blob/unstable/src/modules/TYPES.md) document along with [hellotype.c](https://github.com/antirez/redis/blob/unstable/src/modules/hellotype.c) dive into the API's usage when defining new data types.
3. [Creating a redis Module in 15 lines of code!](https://gist.github.com/dvirsky/83fc32366d5ad82fc3dca47ed2704377) by **[Dvir Volk @dvirsky](https://twitter.com/dvirsky)** is precisely what it says it is - could it be any simpler? [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11677353)
4. Check out some of open source modules developed by **[Redis Labs @RedisLabs](https://twitter.com/redislabs)** that are available from the [Module Hub](http://redismodules.com), including: full text search, image manipulation, password encryption, probabilistic data structure and extended Redis commands. [HN](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=11699728).
5. At this point you're probably firing up your code editor to write you first module, so congrats and another tip: we've put together a devkit with stuff we found useful for module ninjas - clone the [RedisModulesSDK](https://github.com/RedisLabs/RedisModulesSDK) repository to start using it.

The Modules' launch was also picked by bloggers and the media, including:

1. [Redis launches modules to add extensibility to the open source database](http://venturebeat.com/2016/05/10/redis-modules/) by **[Jordan 'Jaws' Novet @jordannovet](https://twitter.com/jordannovet)** in **[VentureBeat @VentureBeat](https://twitter.com/VentureBeat)**
1. [Redis Modules extend NoSQL database's capabilities, increase developer involvement](http://www.techrepublic.com/article/redis-modules-extend-nosql-databases-capabilities-increase-developer-involvement/) by **[Matt Asay @mjasay](https://twitter.com/mjasay)** in **[TechRepublic @TechRepublic](https://twitter.com/TechRepublic)**
1. [Redis plants the seeds for an open source ecosystem](http://www.infoworld.com/article/3068593/open-source-tools/redis-plants-the-seeds-for-an-open-source-ecosystem.html) by **[syegulalp @syegulalp](https://twitter.com/syegulalp)** in **[InfoWorld @infoworld](https://twitter.com/infoworld)**
1. [Redis aims for an infinite variety of data structures](http://itknowledgeexchange.techtarget.com/open-source-insider/redis-aims-infinite-variety-data-structures/) by **[Adrían Bridgwater @ABridgwater](https://twitter.com/ABridgwater)** in **[ITKnowledgeExchange @ITKE](https://twitter.com/ITKE)**
1. [Redis Announces Redis Modules That Facilitate Development Of Additional Use Cases For Redis Database Functionality](https://cloud-computing-today.com/2016/05/15/1074953/) by **[Arnal Dayaratna @cloud4computing](https://twitter.com/cloud4computing)**
1. [(((Hebrew only))) "303 Redis news" podcast](http://www.reversim.com/2016/06/303-redis-news.html) with **[Dvir Volk @dvirsky](https://twitter.com/dvirsky)** with **[orilahav @orilahav](https://twitter.com/orilahav)** and **[Ran Tavory @rantav](https://twitter.com/rantav)** at **[@reversim](https://twitter.com/reversim)**

Lastly, but inarguably most importantly, there are signs of modules being developed by the community. The first two open source community-developed Redis modules are:

1. [redis-locks](https://github.com/jamespedwards42/redis-locks/tree/master/redis/modules) by **James Edwards** is a module that provides a locking mutex - auther is willing to add semaphore too if there's demand, so show him your love.
1. [redis_reference](https://github.com/Prognoos/redis_reference) from **[Felipe Cruz @felipejcruz](https://twitter.com/felipejcruz)** is a specialized, non-production module that is very use-case-specific... but still it's the second ever module so there's that :)

## Virtual Moka Pot

Since time immemorial within the Redis community, a [Moka Pot](http://oldblog.antirez.com/post/redis-moka-awards-2011.html) is considered a token of appreciation to a member for her/his contributions. I'd like to present this one to **[Andy McCurdy @andymccurdy](https://twitter.com/andymccurdy)** for everything he's done for us with [redis-py](https://github.com/andymccurdy/redis-py), the de-facto standard Redis client for **`#Python`**. With a [first public commit](https://github.com/andymccurdy/redis-py/commit/5813d22e0e84c41cc572ada4c014d591ee3f188b) dating back to November 6th 2009, redis-py is one of the first clients ever to be written for Redis and the fact that it had prevailed the tests of time is a testament of Andy's dedication and skill.

Because OSS never stops, maintaining a popular project can become an extremely demanding task. Recently I [OH Andy](https://twitter.com/andymccurdy/status/735713770446585857) tweet _"Looking for some folks to help maintain redis-py. It's been neglected for too long. Please email or DM me."_ and I know of at least one very capable maintainer (hint: **[Dvir Volk @dvirsky](https://twitter.com/dvirsky)**) who'll probably be join Andy in maintaining the excellence.

Andy - for giving us the best Redis client ever (and one of the best Python Redis clients out there ;)), may your coffee always taste as good as a cup of Italian Moka, thank you.

### [Redis 3.2.0 is out!](http://antirez.com/news/104) (6.379 minutes to read)
After a long time in the making (and partly because of a detour in favor of the modules API) v3.2 is finally out! With Geo, `BITFIELD`, **`#Lua`** replication & debugging and too many more improvements to copy-paste. Also, `redis-cli` got a revamp and has useful command hints and its own [documentation page](http://redis.io/topics/rediscli) :)

### [Redis IRC logs](http://irclog.redis.io/)
After the experience of doing the first development iteration of the modules API away from the public's, Lead Dev and his team have decided not to repeat that. As a result, we've moved our discussions to the [`#redis` channel on Freenode](http://webchat.freenode.net/?channels=redis) and the Redis website now logs it.
